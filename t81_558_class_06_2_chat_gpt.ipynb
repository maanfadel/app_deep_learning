        "Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT have brought AI into mainstream use. LLMs allow regular users to interact with AI using natural language. Most of these language models require extreme processing capabilities and hardware. Because of this, application programming interfaces (APIs) accessed through the Internet are becoming common entry points for these models. One of the most compelling features of services like ChatGPT is their availability as an API. But before we dive into the depths of coding and integration, let's understand what an API is and its significance in the AI domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "API stands for Application Programming Interface. Think of it as a bridge or a messenger that allows two different software applications to communicate. In the context of AI and machine learning, APIs often allow developers to access a particular model or service without having to house the model on their local machine. This technique can be beneficial when the model in question, like ChatGPT, is large and resource-intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of AI, APIs have several distinct advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Scalability: Since the actual model runs on external servers, developers don't need to worry about scaling infrastructure.\n",
        "* Maintenance: You get to use the latest and greatest version of the model without constantly updating your local copy.\n",
        "* Cost-Effective: Leveraging external computational resources can be more cost-effective than maintaining high-end infrastructure locally, especially for sporadic or one-off tasks.\n",
        "* Ease of Use: Instead of diving into the nitty-gritty details of model implementation and optimization, developers can directly utilize its capabilities with a few lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we won't be running the neural network computations locally. Instead, our PyTorch code will communicate with the OpenAI API to access and harness the abilities of ChatGPT. The actual execution of the neural network code happens on OpenAI servers, bringing forth a unique synergy of PyTorch's flexibility and ChatGPT's conversational mastery.\n",

        "As we delve deeper into the intricacies of deep learning, it's crucial to understand that the tools and platforms we use are as versatile as the concepts themselves. When it comes to accessing ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art conversational AI model developed by OpenAI, there are two predominant pathways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Direct API Access using Python's HTTP Capabilities: Python, with its rich library ecosystem, provides utilities like requests to directly communicate with APIs over HTTP. This method involves crafting the necessary API calls, handling responses, and error checking, giving the developer a granular control over the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the Official OpenAI Python Library: OpenAI offers an official Python library, aptly named openai, that simplifies the process of integrating with ChatGPT and other OpenAI services. This library abstracts many of the intricacies and boilerplate steps of direct API access, offering a streamlined and user-friendly approach to interacting with the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each approach has its advantages. Direct API access provides a more hands-on, granular approach, allowing developers to intimately understand the intricacies of each API call. On the other hand, using the openai library can accelerate development, reduce potential errors, and allow for a more straightforward integration, especially for those new to API interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will make use of the OpenAI API through a library called LangChain. LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using LLMs. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis. LangChain allows you to quickly change between different underlying LLMs with minimal code changes.\n",

Text extraction focuses on the retrieval of specific pieces of information from a larger body of text. For instance, in scenarios where a dataset contains varied information about individuals—ranging from birthdays to job details—one can employ LLM to zero in on just the birthdays, efficiently filtering out extraneous data. The power of LLM lies in its ability to discern context and extract relevant details based on the user's requirements, as showcased in the code that adeptly identifies and extracts birthday details while disregarding other particulars."
